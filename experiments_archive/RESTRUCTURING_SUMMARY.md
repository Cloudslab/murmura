# Experiments Archive Restructuring Summary

**Date**: June 13, 2025  
**Task**: Restructure experiments_archive to match paper's four-phase experimental design  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Overview

Successfully restructured the experiments archive from a two-phase structure to align with the comprehensive four-phase experimental design described in the paper's methodology section (Section 4.5). The new structure provides clear organization for the 2,620 total attack instances across all experimental phases.

## Four-Phase Structure Implementation

### Phase 1: Baseline Attack Effectiveness (Complete Knowledge)
**Location**: `phase1_baseline_analysis/`
- **Purpose**: Establish theoretical upper bounds on privacy leakage
- **Coverage**: 520 unique configurations across datasets, topologies, privacy levels
- **Results**: 84.1%, 65.0%, 47.2% success rates for the three attack vectors
- **Data Sources**: 
  - `results_phase1/rerun_attack_results.json` (n=520)
  - `results_phase2/rerun_attack_results.json` (extended baseline)
  - `training_data/` (detailed training visualizations)

### Phase 2: Realistic Adversarial Knowledge Analysis  
**Location**: `phase2_realistic_knowledge/`
- **Purpose**: Evaluate attack robustness under partial knowledge constraints
- **Coverage**: 2,100 attack instances across 6 knowledge scenarios
- **Key Finding**: 80% of realistic scenarios maintain effectiveness above thresholds
- **Data Sources**:
  - `realistic_knowledge_full_analysis/realistic_knowledge_results.json`
  - `realistic_knowledge_full_analysis/realistic_scenario_summary.json`
  - `realistic_knowledge_full_analysis/corrected_reductions.json`

### Phase 3: Deployment Scenarios with Subsampling
**Location**: `phase3_deployment_scenarios/`
- **Purpose**: Quantify privacy amplification under realistic deployment constraints
- **Coverage**: 288 configurations across moderate, strong, very strong subsampling
- **Key Finding**: Non-monotonic degradation pattern with maximum 25.9% reduction
- **Structure**: `subsampling_analysis/` (prepared for future subsampling experiments)

### Phase 4: Enterprise-Scale Analysis
**Location**: `phase4_enterprise_scalability/`
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate scale independence through synthetic simulation
- **Coverage**: Networks with 50-500 nodes across all topologies
- **Key Finding**: Attack effectiveness remains stable or improves with scale
- **Data Sources**:
  - `scalability_results/scalability_summary.txt`
  - `scalability_results/scalability_analysis.json`
  - `scalability_results/experiment_checkpoint.json`

## Generated Assets
