# Results Consistency Report - Phase 5 Defense Evaluation

## Overview

This report verifies the consistency of Phase 5 defense evaluation results with baseline attack effectiveness established in previous experimental phases.

## Verification Methodology

1. **Baseline Attack Effectiveness**: Compare Phase 5 no_dp results with Table 1 baseline effectiveness values
2. **Differential Privacy Effectiveness**: Verify DP reduction patterns match Figure dp_effectiveness_flow
3. **Statistical Patterns**: Ensure distributions and ranges are reasonable
4. **Experiment Coverage**: Confirm complete experimental space coverage

## Key Consistency Metrics

- **Total Experiments Processed**: 808 (520 regular DP + 288 sub-sampling)
- **Attack Vector Coverage**: All three attack types evaluated
- **Topology Coverage**: Star, complete, ring, line topologies
- **Privacy Level Coverage**: no_dp through very_strong_dp

## Validation Results

✅ **Baseline Attack Effectiveness**: Consistent with established values
✅ **Differential Privacy Patterns**: Matches expected reduction rates
✅ **Statistical Distributions**: Within reasonable bounds
✅ **Experimental Coverage**: Complete coverage achieved

## Conclusion

Phase 5 defense evaluation results demonstrate strong consistency with previously established baseline effectiveness patterns. The comprehensive evaluation of 808 experiments provides robust foundation for defense mechanism conclusions.
