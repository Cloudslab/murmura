## Executive Summary

This detailed analysis provides granular insights into defense mechanism effectiveness across 3,120 evaluations (520 experiments × 6 defense configurations), breaking down performance by attack type, network topology, dataset, and defense mechanism combinations.

## Defense Mechanism Configurations Explained

### 1. Structural Noise Injection

**Description**: Adds calibrated noise to obscure topology-based signatures in three key areas.

**Components**:
- **Communication Noise**: Injects dummy communications to hide real patterns
- **Timing Noise**: Adds Gaussian noise to communication timestamps  
- **Magnitude Noise**: Applies multiplicative noise to parameter norms

**Configurations**:
| Strength | Comm Noise Rate | Timing Noise Std | Magnitude Noise Multiplier |
|----------|----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Weak     | 10%            | 5%               | 5%                        |
| Medium   | 20%            | 15%              | 15%                       |
| Strong   | 30%            | 30%              | 30%                       |

### 2. Dynamic Topology Reconfiguration

**Description**: Periodically changes network topology during training to disrupt attack pattern recognition.

**Components**:
- **Reconfiguration Frequency**: How often topology changes (every N rounds)
- **Connectivity Preservation**: Ensures network remains connected after changes
- **Random Topology Generation**: Creates new random topologies maintaining node count

**Configurations**:
| Strength | Reconfiguration Frequency | Connectivity Preservation |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Weak     | Every 10 rounds          | Yes                       |
| Medium   | Every 5 rounds           | Yes                       |
| Strong   | Every 3 rounds           | Yes                       |

### 3. Combined Defense Strategies

**Description**: Integrates multiple protection mechanisms for layered security against diverse attack vectors.

**What "Combined" Means Exactly**:

#### Combined Weak Configuration:
- **Structural Noise**: 5% communication noise, 5% timing noise, 5% magnitude noise
- **Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Disabled

#### Combined Medium Configuration:
- **Structural Noise**: 10% communication noise, 10% timing noise, 10% magnitude noise
- **Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Disabled

#### Combined Strong Configuration:
- **Structural Noise**: 15% communication noise, 15% timing noise, 15% magnitude noise
- **Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Every 5 rounds (enabled only in strong configuration)

**Rationale**: Individual defenses may miss certain attack vectors, so combining them provides comprehensive protection against communication pattern, parameter magnitude, and topology structure attacks simultaneously.

- **Dynamic reconfiguration shows some effect** but limited overall impact

## Topology-Specific Performance Analysis

### Dynamic Reconfiguration by Network Topology

| Topology | Defense Strength | Success Rate | Avg Effectiveness | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Star** | Weak | 0.0% | 0.00% | No successful reconfigurations |
| **Star** | Medium | 0.0% | 0.00% | No successful reconfigurations |
| **Star** | Strong | **44.2%** | **5.56%** | Only topology showing success |
| **Ring** | All strengths | 0.0% | 0.00% | No successful reconfigurations |
| **Line** | All strengths | 0.0% | 0.00% | No successful reconfigurations |
| **Complete** | All strengths | 0.0% | 0.00% | No successful reconfigurations |

**Why Dynamic Reconfiguration Shows Limited Effectiveness**:

1. **Implementation Challenges**:
   - Maintaining network connectivity while changing topology is complex
   - Random topology generation may not meaningfully disrupt attack patterns
   - Connectivity preservation constraints limit reconfiguration options

2. **Topology-Specific Issues**:
   - **Star topologies**: Central node creates natural reconfiguration opportunities
   - **Ring topologies**: Limited reconfiguration options while maintaining ring structure
   - **Line topologies**: Sequential structure hard to reconfigure meaningfully
   - **Complete graphs**: Already fully connected, minimal reconfiguration impact

3. **Frequency Limitations**:
   - Reconfiguration every 3-10 rounds may be too infrequent
   - Attacks may adapt quickly to new topologies
   - Need more aggressive reconfiguration (every 1-2 rounds)

### Structural Noise Effectiveness by Topology

| Topology | Structural Weak | Structural Medium | Structural Strong |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Star** | 15.1% ±11.8% | 15.2% ±12.4% | 15.3% ±12.1% |
| **Ring** | 15.3% ±12.1% | 15.4% ±12.6% | 15.5% ±12.4% |
| **Line** | 15.2% ±11.9% | 15.4% ±12.5% | 15.4% ±12.3% |
| **Complete** | 15.4% ±12.0% | 15.5% ±12.7% | 15.6% ±12.4% |

**Key Observations**:
- **Consistent across topologies** - structural noise works regardless of network structure
- **Complete graphs show slightly higher effectiveness** - more communication patterns to obscure
- **Ring topologies benefit from timing noise** - disrupts sequential communication patterns


## Dataset Performance Comparison

### MNIST vs HAM10000 Defense Effectiveness

| Defense Mechanism | MNIST Performance | HAM10000 Performance | Difference |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Structural Noise (Strong) | 15.5% ±12.1% | 15.4% ±12.5% | +0.1% |
| Structural Noise (Medium) | 15.4% ±12.3% | 15.4% ±12.7% | 0.0% |
| Structural Noise (Weak) | 15.3% ±11.8% | 15.2% ±12.1% | +0.1% |
| Combined (Medium) | 15.1% ±12.3% | 15.0% ±12.7% | +0.1% |
| Combined (Strong) | 14.8% ±12.0% | 14.7% ±12.4% | +0.1% |

**Dataset Insights**:
- **Minimal dataset dependency** - defenses work consistently across MNIST and HAM10000
- **Slightly better MNIST performance** - may be due to simpler data patterns
- **Consistent ranking** - defense mechanism ordering remains the same across datasets
