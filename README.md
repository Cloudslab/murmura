A decentralized/P2P federated learning framework and simulator.

## Overview

Murmura is a framework designed to facilitate and simulate federated learning in decentralized and peer-to-peer environments. It enables researchers and developers to experiment with distributed machine learning scenarios while maintaining data privacy and reducing central coordination requirements.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project is under active development and not yet ready for production use.

## Planned Features

- Decentralized federated learning implementation
- P2P network simulation capabilities
- Privacy-preserving learning protocols
- Customizable node behaviors and network topologies
- Performance metrics and analysis tools

## Development Status

The project is currently in active development. Key components and features are being implemented and tested. Stay tuned for updates and release announcements.
