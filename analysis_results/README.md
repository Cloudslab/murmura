# Analysis Results Directory

This directory contains analysis outputs and summaries from trust monitoring experiments.

## Files

### `cusum_trust_scores_complete.txt`
Complete trust score evolution data extracted from CUSUM detection experiments.

**Content:**
- Trust scores for each monitoring node across all rounds
- Malicious node identifications for each experiment
- Round-by-round trust evolution patterns

**Format:**
```
## experiment_name.txt
Malicious Nodes: [X, Y, Z]

=== Node N Trust Scores ===
Round   node_A (M)   node_B   node_C (M)
1       1.000        1.000    1.000
2       0.850        1.000    0.900
...
```

Where `(M)` indicates malicious nodes.

### `trust_scores_summary.md`
Human-readable summary of trust score analysis patterns and findings.

## Usage

These files are generated by analysis scripts and serve as:
1. **Input data** for paper figures and analysis
2. **Reference material** for understanding trust evolution patterns
3. **Archive** of experimental results for reproducibility

## Related Scripts

- `scripts/analyze_enhanced_results.py` - Generates new analysis results
- `scripts/analyze_existing_cusum_results.py` - Processes existing CUSUM data

## Data Format Notes

- Trust scores range from 0.0 (complete distrust) to 1.0 (full trust)
- Malicious nodes are marked with `(M)` in headers
- Round numbers typically go from 1-10 for standard experiments
- Node indices correspond to network topology positions
